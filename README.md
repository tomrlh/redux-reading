# Project - Readable
Blog Post app with React, developed during React Nanodegree from Udacity.

## Important

This project depends on the 'api-server' directory, once it was modified to increment new features. So I will reference the directories as 'API directory' and 'Root directory'.

***

## API directory available Scripts

You must run:

**1 - `npm install` or `yarn install`**

Will install all dependecies.

**2 - `node server`**

Runs the api in [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001).

## Root directory available Scripts

You must run:

**1 - `npm install` or `yarn install`**

Will install all dependecies.

**2 - `npm start` or `yarn start`**

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
